# Dockerize e2e and unit test of applications built with Angular 2

This repo aims to demo how to dockerize e2e and unit tests of Angular 2 applications.

---

## First Part: quick start to do e2e and unit tests inside Docker container

* Steps:

1. Build Docker image
```sh
$ docker build -t ng2-app:v1 .
```

2. Run **ng test --single-run** inside Docker container
```sh
$ docker run --name ng2-karma -v $(pwd):/app/ --rm ng2-app:v1 ng test --single-run
```

3. Run **ng e2e** inside Docker container
```sh
$ docker run --name ng2-e2e -v $(pwd):/app/ --rm ng2-app:v1 ng e2e
```

---

## Second Part: Dockerize your own e2e and unit tests

Use **ng new <PROJECT-NAME>** to create a new project. Copy Dockerfile and xvfb-chromium into the project folder and then go back to first part to create Docker image. Enjoy dockerized e2e and unit tests.

## Third Part: this is automatically generated by **angular cli**

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
